        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>ARC is an all-volunteer union of Albuquerque tenants working together
          to bring our concerns and demands to our collective landlords and local
          officials. It is our collective duty as residents of Albuquerque to
          stand up for each other and demand better living conditions.</p>

      <section class="what-we-believe">
        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>We believe that everyone has the right to live in a place they’re
          proud to call home. In New Mexico, that means AC when it’s hot, heat
          when it’s cold, and clean, hot water on demand (not to mention no
          vermin infestations). The fact that so many landlords in this city
          fail to provide these basic necessities is absolutely unacceptable.
          As tenants, we have the right to stand together and demand better and
          safer conditions for the homes we share with our children and loved
          ones.</p>

      <section class="what-we-want">
        <h2>What We Want</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to bring tenants together so we can stand up to powerful
          slumlords to demand—and achieve—better living conditions.</p>

        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>As a volunteer organization, we’re only as powerful as our membership.
          We need your help. Whether that looks like coming out to organize new
          buildings, fighting to change rental laws at the state level, or even
          just talking to your neighbors is up to you — but we’re only going to
          win if we all do as much as we can.</p>
