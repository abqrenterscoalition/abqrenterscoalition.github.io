      <h1>What We Believe</h1>
      <p>
        We believe that everyone has the right to live in a place they’re proud
        to call home. In New Mexico, that means AC when it’s hot, heat when it’s
        cold, and clean, hot water on demand (not to mention no vermin
        infestations). The fact that so many landlords in this city fail to
        provide these basic necessities is absolutely unacceptable. As tenants,
        we have the right to stand together and demand better and safer
        conditions for the homes we share with our children and loved ones.
